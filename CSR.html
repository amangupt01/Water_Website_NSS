                                                Pidilite Industries Ltd contributed to CSR towards Water resource management and infrastructure development for Agriculture, etc.
                                                A major focus of the project was to support activities for the Conservation of water and efficient usage of water-soluble fertilizers.
                                                Under this project, approximately 512 hectares of farmland were covered under drip irrigation. In order to increase the quality of groundwater, the corporation has continued to recharge wells. During the year, 221 wells in Mahuva Taluka's 27 villages were refilled. For the purpose of giving technical inputs to farmers, the firm has established arrangements/signed MOUs with numerous institutes and professional organizations. These tie-ups have aided farmers in adopting a modern package of methods for working towards reducing input costs and boosting yields of vital crops in the region, such as cotton, onion, groundnut, coconut, and so on.

                                            The Hebbal Lake in Mysuru, which is stretched over 40 acres in the Hebbal Industrial Area, was formerly a major supply of drinkable water. The lake, however, lost its beauty over time as a result of the vast urbanization that surrounded it. Untreated sewage from residential and industrial enterprises began to pour into the lake and its environs. To revive the lake and restore its former splendor, the firm partnered with the Mysore administration – KIADB and MUDA. Desilting and beautification were part of the project, which included the creation of a walking path and the planting of trees surrounding it. A sewage treatment facility (STP) near the lake is being built with the capacity to treat 8 million liters of sewage per day, removing untreated sewage from the lake and its environs. The STP will use advanced membrane bioreactor technology to ensure that only the best quality products are used.
                                            This lake rejuvenation and conservation project is intended to serve as a model for similar initiatives that can be implemented by government agencies around the country.

                                        They aim to address the water crisis by pursuing innovative approaches that promote circular use of this limited natural resource, such as appropriately treating wastewater for groundwater recharge, conserving water, ensuring access to clean and safe drinking water, using treated water for afforestation and agriculture, and sensitising stakeholders in communities and within STL through engagement programmes that promote responsible use.
                                        STL has recently partnershiped with World Bank’s 2030 Water Resources Group. They works together to identify innovative and tech-driven solutions to save water resources and increase water security through long-term behavioural change, groundwater replenishment, and improved livelihoods. Till now, very large quantity of water has been recuycled and reused through their water intervention.

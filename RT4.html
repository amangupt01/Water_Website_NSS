                                            The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, located between Hawaii and California, is the world's largest accumulation of ocean plastic. It is a massive accumulation of garbage in the North Pacific Ocean caused primarily by nations near the Pacific Rim.It is divided into two patches: the Western Garbage Patch, which is near to Japan and runs all the way to Hawaii, and the Eastern Garbage Patch, which is located between Hawaii and California.

                                            What are the causes of the creation of such garbage patches in the ocean?

                                            Litter in the oceans (known as marine debris) congregates due to the presence of gyres(A gyre is a whirling circulation of ocean currents that drags anything in its path). When an item floats closer to the centre of a gyre, it stays there. The North Pacific gyre formed the Great Pacific Garbage Patch by drawing marine garbage over time, and it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch contains an estimated 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic, 94 percent of which is made up of microplastics. However, microplastics make for just 8% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch's overall weight of 79,000 tonnes. The rest is made up of plastics greater than 0.5 cm in diameter, the majority of which is abandoned fishing gear. Fishing nets account for 46% of all trash. These larger pieces of trash deteriorate over time when they are exposed to the forces of nature, but they break down into microplastics that still pollute the oceans.

                                                Animals mistake plastic for food,causing malnutrition.There is 180x more plastic floating at the surface of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) than marine life. Animals traveling through or living in this region are likely to consume the patch's plastic.

                                                Because 84 percent of this plastic was discovered to have at least one Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxic (PBT) compound, animals consuming this trash are absorbing the toxins connected to the plastic.

                                                The abundance of fishing nets in the patch is also a fatal hazard to marine life. Animals that swim into these abandoned nets might become entangled, choking, and drowning.

                                                Once plastic enters the marine food web, it can contaminate the human food chain as well. Efforts to clean up and eliminate ocean plastic have also resulted in enormous financial costs.

                                                Chemicals in plastics enter the body of the animal feeding on the plastic through a process known as bioaccumulation. When the feeder becomes prey, the chemicals transfer to the predator, working their way up the food chain to humans. These toxins that harmed the plastic feeders might then be found in humans.

The expenditures are incurred as a result of the impact on tourists, fisheries and aquaculture, and governmental cleanups.

Expeditions and research into the patch and other gyres loaded with the world's trash have been pioneered by the organization.

They now have a 600-meter U-shaped floating tube that floats with the ocean currents and gathers trash, including microplastics, with a 3-meter-deep screen that marine life may swim behind. Resulting from several research missions, traveling across and above the GPGP, The Ocean Cleanup team compiled an unprecedented amount of data to better understand the plastic that persists in this region

The multi-level trawl enabled the crew to explore further into the water and determine the depths to which buoyant plastic may be spread.

Because it is well known that dangerous PBT (Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxic) compounds may be detected in ocean plastics, several researchers analyzed plastic samples from the excursions to determine their chemical levels.

										<h1>Rajendra Singh</h1>

									<p> Popularly known as ‘The Water Man of India,’ Rajendra Singh has been widely
                                         recognized and appreciated for his water restoration efforts in rural India.
                                        A proud winner of the Magsaysay Award and the Stockholm Water Prize, he has worked 
                                        extensively for water education, especially in rural areas. When Rajendra Singh 
                                        reached Rajasthan in 1959 to set up health centers in the region, he realized that
                                        people needed water more than health care. So he started working with the villagers 
                                        to build mud dams called Johads – a traditional technique of collecting rainwater that 
                                        improves percolation and helps recharge the groundwater table. A Johad is a rainwater 
                                        storage wetland principally used for effectively harnessing water resources that collects
                                        and stores water throughout the year, to be used for the purpose of recharging the groundwater
                                         in the nearby water wells, washing, bathing and drinking by humans and cattle. Rainwater fills
                                        the pit. These are connected to other small pits like this. The extra rainwater 
                                        is filled in the smaller pits. They are then used for cleaning, drinking and washing 
                                        purposes.He solved the problem of water scarcity in Rajasthan by disseminating information
                                        on traditional water conservation technologies. Today, after about 20 years of work, 
                                        there are nearly 8,600 Johads and other similar structures that collect water in the state,
                                        providing water to over 1,000 villages across Rajasthan. This resulted in a steady rise 
                                        in the groundwater table and an increase in the forest cover in the area that was destroyed 
                                        by deforestation and mining activities. Advocating the use of Johad, rainwater storage tanks, 
                                        check dams, and other traditional path-breaking techniques, he established the 
                                        ‘Tarun Bharat Sangh’ (TBS) in 1975. TBS has been instrumental in fighting the slow bureaucracy,
                                        mining lobby and has helped villagers take charge of water management in their semi-arid area. 
                                         By 2001, TBS had spread over 6,500 sq km, including parts of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, 
                                        and Andhra Pradesh. In September 2010, Rajendra Singh planned to start ‘Ganga Panchayats’
                                        to restore the sanctity and ecology of the river Ganga. The idea was that panchayats would
                                         keep a close watch on all governmental activities that may potentially threaten the ecological 
                                        working of river Ganga, not only in Uttarakhand but the entire river stretch from its origin 
                                        in Gangotri to Gangasagar. He also played a pivotal role in stopping the controversial 
                                        Loharinag Pala Hydro Power Project over river Bhagirathi. His other initiatives include 
                                        leading a pada yatra of environmentalists and NGOs through Mumbai city along the endangered 
                                        Mithi river and organizing a parikrama along the banks of Godavari river, from Trimbakeshwar 
                                        to Paithan, to urge people to make the river pollution-free. Rajendra Singh is one of the most
                                        globally renowned environmentalists known for his pioneering community-based efforts in water 
                                        harvesting and water management.

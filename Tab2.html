										<h3>Not all heroes wear capes, some fight amongst us: Exemplary stories in water conservation
                                        </h3>
									</header>
									<p>Immense water pollution, the wrath of prolonged droughts, the dipping water table, 
                                        water-borne diseases – are just some of the many issues we constantly hear about 
                                        when discussing water scarcity in India. People living in rural parts of the country 
                                        are fighting everyday battles against harsh weather conditions and long distances to get 
                                        access to safe drinking water. Many urban dwellers are also stuck with a limited water 
                                        supply and poor drinking water quality. According to reports, 21% of communicable diseases 
                                        in India are related to unsafe water, and 75% of the country’s rivers and lakes are so polluted 
                                        that people cannot use their water for drinking or bathing. While the entire nation is struggling 
                                        with water shortage, many across the country are going out of their way to conserve water.
                                         Here are four such inspiring journeys of people who took responsibility to find bold, creative,
                                          and innovative solutions to restore our planet.

                                                and Stockholm Water Prize in 2015. He believes in 'water literacy', 
                                                which involves understanding water and the socio-economic landscape dependent on water sources, 
                                                practicing water conservation through various measures, and making other people understand

											<p>Popularly known as Paani Mata, Amla Ruia is one of the most active figures in water
                                                 conservation and management. Even though she hails from an affluent family, she has 
                                                 been able to relate to the sorrows of the poor and the needy. She feels that water and 
                                                 education are the two foremost issues in India, and thus she focuses on solving these problems.
                                                 Through her consistent efforts in spreading water literacy, building check dams,

												<h3>Ayyappa Masagi</h3>
											</header>
											<p> Quitting his job as an engineer, Ayyappa Masagi started his career as a water activist 
                                                when he was in his late fifties. His motto- “Every drop counts”- was brought to life when
                                                 he founded the Water Literacy Foundation. Together with his team of activists and 
                                                 conservationists, Masagi has not only changed the scenario of water conservation but 
                                                 also impacted a large number of lives. A devout believer of community efforts, he has 
                                                 built over 700 artificial lakes, making his name appear in the Limca Book of World records.

												<h3>Aabid Surti</h3>
											</header>
											<p> 84-year-old artist and writer, Aabid Surti is an epitome of dedication and determination. 
                                                Saving over 20 million liters of water single-handedly, he emphasizes the importance of 
                                                every single drop of water. He founded an NGO called Drop Dead Foundation that fixes leaking 
                                                taps in residential houses in Mumbai, free of charge. With his simple but consistent efforts, 
                                                he has managed to create a massive impact on the community and saved a lot of water from going 
                                                down the drains. He also organizes awareness campaigns and activities to sensitize people, 
                                                particularly children, on the global water crisis.

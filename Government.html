                                        The Indian government has begun the process of building desalination facilities to satisfy the demands of those who do not have access to safe drinking water. The government has promoted rainwater collection systems on a considerable basis.[10]
                                        The Government of India has established National Water Mission as one of the eight National Missions under the National Action Plan on Climate Change. The Union Cabinet approved (on 6th April, 2011) the comprehensive Mission Document for National Water Mission (NWM).  The main objective of NWM is “conservation of water, minimizing wastage and ensuring its more equitable distribution both across and within States through integrated water resources development and management”. NWM has identified five goals.
                                        The Water Resources Information System (WRIS) database contains information on 15,615 named rivers and streams in the United States. Several rivers have been recognised as part of the National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) and National Ganga River Basin Authority programmes (NGRBA). The NRCP has covered filthy segments of 31 rivers in 75 towns across 14 states at a cost of Rs. 4,517.82 crore.[1]

                                        The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has established a water quality monitoring network. 2101 locations are monitored on a monthly basis whereas 893 locations are on a half yearly basis and 6 locations on a yearly basis. 
                                        Out of 38254 MLD of sewage generated by class I cities and class II towns, only 11787 MLD has been treated. There are no specific standards for discharge of treated sewage into streams. The sewage generation is estimated to be 62000 MLD approximately while sewage treatment capacity developed so far is only 23277 MLD from 816 STPs.[2]
                                        The National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) of India encompasses 190 towns and 41 rivers. Its objective has been to return the Ganga river to 'bathing class' status, as specified by India's DBU classification system. The NRCP has been chastised for a lack of collaboration among various implementing authorities, financing disparities among sites, and an inability to keep up with the expanding sewage burden.[3]

                                    Improper disposal of wastes has been one of the leading causes for the pollution of water in India. This Act was formulated with the view of regulating the disposal of waste and effluents into the river by the factories. Mahanadi and Brahmani amount to be the most polluted rivers amongst the rivers present in the state of Orissa. About 50 percent of water is polluted in these rivers which ultimately makes the survival of human life quite difficult.

                                        Industrial waste is one of the causes of water pollution. Water gets polluted through the toxic or non-biodegradable substances when the processing of these materials is being done in any industry. Such industries are required to pay cess under this law. Section 3 of this Act provides an exemption to industries from levying cess on those industries, which consume water below the specified limit.

                                    The Damodar Valley has been among the most flourished river basins which the country has witnessed since time immemorial. During the monsoon season, 80 percent of the waste from mines and industries is discharged into this river. This results in the pollution of water. With the view of keeping a check on the functioning of this valley, Damodar Valley Corporation was established.

                                        The Indian Judiciary has initiated a positive step, with the view of controlling pollution of water. Under the Indian Constitution, the scope of Article 21, Article 48 and Article 51(g) can include the right to clean water. In the leading case of MC Mehta vs The Union of India, the court held that preventing the water of river Ganga from being polluted is the need of the hour.
                                        Along with society, the government also has a role to play in providing solutions to the issue of water scarcity. The government has taken several initiatives to deal with the water scarcity problem.[5]
                                        The recent one “Humara Jal, Humara Jeevan” is creating a great awareness among the masses. The initiative was undertaken to address the issue and to provide accurate solutions.
                                        The Government of India has adopted various initiatives to deal with the problem of water scarcity. Few of them are:The National Water Policy, Bharat Nirman, Humara Jal, Humara Jeevan, National Water Mission, National Mission for Clean Ganga, Namami Gange Initiative: Rejuvenating River Ganga
                                        Polluted waterways affect the standard of living of many Indian families. Toxic waste such as discarded plastic and domestic sewage is damaging the fishing industry. In an effort to combat water pollution, the Indian state of Kerala has started an initiative to recycle ocean plastic into materials for road construction. Repurposing ocean plastic for use in building materials reduces the cost of roads and water pollution. Cleaning and sorting the gathered plastic provides jobs to local women in Kerala. The project has collected about 176,000 pounds of plastic and has built 135 kilometers of road.

                                        The National Water Policy (2012) has been formulated by the Department of Water Resources, RD &.GR, inter-alia, advocates rainwater harvesting and conservation of water. Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has issued directions under Section 5 of "The Environment Protection Act, 1986" for mandatory Rainwater Harvesting / Roof Top Rain Water harvesting. The Ministry of Rural Development in consultation and agreement with the Department of. Water Resources, RD & GR has developed an. actionable framework for Natural Resources Management (NRM) to ensure gainful utilization of funds.
                                        Mass awareness programmes (Trainings, Seminars, Workshops, Exhibitions, Trade Fares and.Painting Competitions etc.) are conducted from time to time each year in various parts of the Country to promote rainwater harvesting and artificial recharge to ground water. The Department of Land Resources is currently implementing 8214 watershed projects in 28 States covering an area of about 39.07 million ha. The major activities taken up under the WDC-PMKSY, inter-alia, include treatment, drainage line afforestation, soil and moisture conservation, rain water harvesting and horticulture. The Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs has released Model Building Bye-laws, 2016 which recommends Rainwater Harvesting for all types of Building with plot size 100 sq.m or more.

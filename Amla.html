										<h1>Amla Ruia</h1>
									</header>
									<img src="images/Amla.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p> Though born with a silver spoon in her mouth, Amla Ruia's heart bled seeing people's sufferings
                                        due to acute water shortage. Flipping television channels, Ruia froze at the images from a village 
                                        in Rajasthan that was reeling under severe drought in 1998. This moved her soul, and she then 
                                        founded the Aakar Charitable Trust (ACT). ACT partners with villages to build check dams that
                                        provide water security. Her first check dam project was in Mandawar village in Rajasthan, which was a 
                                        huge success. Farmers managed to earn up to 120 million rupees in a year via the two check dams built 
                                        by Aakar Charitable Trust. The check dams allow the aquifers to be replenished during the monsoon so 
                                        that bore wells and hand-pumps are recharged. Villagers have been able to grow up to three crops per 
                                        year and keep livestock. Cultivable land in the villages has increased, and farmworkers who migrated 
                                        to cities in search of jobs have returned home. Ruia estimates that the resulting increased income 
                                        gives a 750% return on the investment in the check dams. Girls are able to attend school, as they no 
                                        longer need to help their mothers carry water from long distances, and students can undertake tertiary 
                                        education. Women have been spared the struggle of finding water, and health and hygiene levels in the 
                                        villages have improved. Her check dams have thus brought back prosperity to the villages, making her 
                                        known as Paani Mata. For Ruia, this has given great satisfaction and the motivation to build more dams. 
                                        By the end of 2017, Aakar Charitable Trust had built more than 200 check dams in more than 115 villages 
                                        in Rajasthan, with flow-on effects to almost 200 other villages. From 2000 to 2005, they also built 200 
                                        Drinking Water Kunds (ancestral type) in which a total of one crore liters of pure natural drinking water 
                                        from the rains is collected year after year in the remotest areas where no municipal water is available. 
                                        To encourage mass-scale Water harvesting by the villagers, the trust organized 'The Aakar Jal Puraskar' 
                                        of Rs. 1,00,000, which was given annually to the village that did the best water harvesting in Maharashtra 
                                        from 2003 to 2006. In 2011, Ruia was awarded a Lakshmipat Singhania - IIM Lucknow National Leadership Award 
                                        in Community Service and Social Upliftment. In 2016, she was nominated for the Women of Worth Social Award 
                                        category. In 2018, she received the India Eye International Human Rights Observer Achievement Award 2018. 
                                        Amla Ruia is one of India's most active water conservationists and has done pioneering work in this field.

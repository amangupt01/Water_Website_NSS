									<p> Dr. Ayyappa Masagi is the Managing Director at the Water Literacy Foundation in India.
                                         He is known fondly as 'Water Warrior' and has transformed water management systems in many 
                                         states across India. He firmly believes that India and the world have enough water for everybody, 
                                         provided we use this precious resource judiciously and without greed, particularly when it comes 
                                         to the private industry's water consumption. Masagi is from a small village in the Gadag District 
                                         of North Karnataka. As a child, he helped provide water to his family by walking miles every day '
                                         with his mother in the wee hours. His passion for water conservation started because of this and 
                                         grew as he gained relevant knowledge from his parents and researched water and agriculture. 
                                         Wanting to pursue his passion for helping India's growing water scarcity issue, he quit his 
                                         job and founded the Water Literacy Foundation in 2005. WLF is a powerful team of activists 
                                         training more and more water warriors to conserve water for the present and future generations. 
                                         They strive to address water scarcity faced by the rural brethren, urban and industrial sectors. 
                                         WLF conducts awareness programs and rallies in rural areas, thus convincing farmers of solutions 
                                         for water scarcity and assuring crop yield even during droughts. Nicknamed "Water Gandhi", Masagi 
                                         is famous for reversing the fortunes of thousands by getting them to practice rainwater harvesting 
                                         and water conservation. He has driven the construction of hundreds of lakes and water-saving projects 
                                         and rejuvenated over 1000 dry boreholes. He has also been noted in the Limca Book of World records 
                                         for having built over 700 artificial lakes. Masagi's career is dedicated to making every drop count, 
                                         and he ensures that his domestic water use is no different. He has specifically modified his home 
                                         to be as water-wise as possible by installing a rooftop rainwater harvesting system and collecting 
                                         greywater in an outside pit to replenish groundwater. Masagi believes that community support can do 
                                         wonders and aims to provide all people with clean and safe water on a daily basis.  Ayyappa Masagi is 
                                         one of our water heroes who has dedicated his life to improving India's water management practices and 
                                         encouraging people to make every drop count.

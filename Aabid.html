										<h1>Aabid Surti</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Aabid.png" alt=""/></span>
									<p>  Aabid Surti, a national award winner with over 80 books to his credit, is a well-known water 
                                        activist who almost single-handedly has saved over 20 million liters of water. Having earned global 
                                        recognition for his work, Surti had a prosperous and satisfactory life. But there was something 
                                        that bothered him perennially – the thought of water being wasted. Coming from a family with members 
                                        standing in queues for hours for a trifle of water, Surti understood the importance of water from 
                                        childhood. Brought up on the pavement, watching people fight for every bucket of water, he grew up 
                                        to comprehend the value of every single drop of water. Consequently, it piqued him to see even a drop 
                                        of water being wasted. As he says, the sound of water leakage used to bother him every time. He read 
                                        a newspaper article in 2007 that explained that a tap that dripped once every second would lead to the 
                                        wastage of over 1000 liters of water a month. This article hit him like a wall, and he became aware of 
                                        the severity of the looming global water crisis. He decided to save water in whatever little capacity 
                                        he could. This marks the birth of the Drop Dead Foundation (DDF), which uses the tagline, "save every 
                                        drop, or drop dead". DDF is a non-governmental organization (NGO) which fixes leaking taps in residential 
                                        houses in Mumbai, free of charge. Every Sunday, the Drop Dead team fixes leakages in apartments on Mira 
                                        Road in the city. Every week they target a building, and on the first day of the week, they meet the 
                                        secretary and explain their purpose. After his permission, they put posters that read 'Save Every Drop 
                                        or Drop Dead' on the notice board. On Saturday, their pamphlets giving out all the details reach every 
                                        house in the building. Finally, they start from the top floor on Sunday, knocking on every door and fixing 
                                        faucets. The foundation primarily checks for leakages in lower-middle-class family households, also called 
                                        "ghettos", where the residents are either too poor to regularly pay for plumbing and maintenance or 
                                        would simply not care. Here, Surti and his foundation reach to fix leakages without any cost at all. 
                                        In the past ten years, Drop Dead Foundation has visited more than 10,000 households and has repaired more 
                                        than 5500 leaking taps saving more than 20 Million liters of water from going down the drains. Surti has 
                                        come across many financial challenges in his journey, but nothing could stop him from achieving his goal. 
                                        He firmly believes that God becomes one’s fundraiser if one does something with complete transparency. 
                                        Every time he needed money to keep Drop Dead Foundation running, God helped him. Help came in the form of 
                                        actor Amitabh Bachchan who gave him Rs. 11 lakh, Maharashtra government that helped him with an award of 
                                        Rs. 50,000, a plumber who worked with him for free, and many other similar instances. On talking about 
                                        future prospects, Surti says that he is moving a step forward by motivating school children to conserve 
                                        water. He has already partnered with two premier schools in Mumbai to propagate the message of water 
                                        conservation. He considers the students as angels carrying forward the message to save water by undertaking
                                         campaigns and putting up water conservation posters in their buildings. This 84-year-old artist and writer
                                          is one of our water heroes who took the unwavering commitment to make water-saving changes in his 
                                          community, one tap at a time.
